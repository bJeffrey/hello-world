ideas and project plans

Hello!

I'm Electrical and Computer Engineering major in my junior year at Oregon State University.  I'm Gimbal Team Captain for OSU Robotics Club and am developing C based software that provides stability and control of a camera mounted to a quadcopter.

I'll be adding snippits of programs as well as complete programs that provide instruction for commonly-used algorithms such as insertion sort, merge sort, et cetera.
